To watch for changes to Redis keys starting with a specific prefix (e.g., 'abcd') and print the key and its new value using `redis-rs`, you need to use Redis's Keyspace Notifications feature. Here's a breakdown of how to do it, along with a Rust code snippet:

**1. Enable Keyspace Notifications in Redis**

By default, keyspace notifications are often disabled because they consume some CPU resources. [[1]](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/keyspace-notifications/) You need to enable them in your Redis configuration (`redis.conf`) or dynamically using the `CONFIG SET` command.

To enable notifications for key events (like `SET`) and generic commands, you can set:

```
CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events KEA
```

*   `K`: Keyspace events, published with `__keyspace@<db>__` prefix. [[1]](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/keyspace-notifications/)
*   `E`: Keyevent events, published with `__keyevent@<db>__` prefix. [[1]](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/keyspace-notifications/)
*   `A`: Alias for `g$lshztxed` (all event types). `g` is for generic commands (like `DEL`, `EXPIRE`), `$` for string commands, `l` for list, `s` for set, `h` for hash, `z` for sorted set, `t` for stream, `x` for expiry, `e` for eviction, `d` for module events. [[2]](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/howto/keyspacenotifications)

You can choose a more specific set of events if needed to minimize overhead. For instance, `K$g` would enable keyspace events for string commands and generic commands. [[2]](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/howto/keyspacenotifications)

**2. Rust Code Snippet using `redis-rs`**

The following Rust code connects to a Redis instance, subscribes to keyspace events, filters for events on keys starting with "abcd", and then fetches and prints the key and its value when a "set" operation occurs.

```rust
use redis::{Commands, Msg};

fn main() -> redis::RedisResult<()> {
    // --- 1. Connect to Redis ---
    let client = redis::Client::open("redis://127.0.0.1/")?;
    let mut con = client.get_connection()?;
    let mut pubsub_con = client.get_connection()?; // Separate connection for Pub/Sub

    println!("Connected to Redis. Waiting for key changes starting with 'abcd'...");

    // --- 2. Configure Keyspace Notifications (Optional here, better to set in redis.conf) ---
    // It's generally better to configure this in redis.conf or via redis-cli once.
    // If you must do it from the client, you might need a separate, non-pubsub connection.
    // let _: () = con.config_set("notify-keyspace-events", "KEA")?;
    // println!("Ensured notify-keyspace-events is set (best to configure in redis.conf).");


    // --- 3. Subscribe to Keyspace Events ---
    let mut pubsub = pubsub_con.as_pubsub();

    // We subscribe to all key events on database 0 that start with "abcd"
    // Format: __keyspace@<db>__:<key_pattern>
    // The pattern for keyspace notifications is __keyspace@<db>__:<key>
    // To get all events for keys starting with "abcd", we subscribe to __keyevent@<db>__:set
    // and then filter the key from the message.
    // Alternatively, subscribing to __keyspace@0__:abcd* and listening for "set" messages.
    pubsub.psubscribe("__keyevent@0__:set")?; // Listen to all 'set' events on DB 0
                                             // We will filter by key prefix in the loop.
                                             // Or, more specific: pubsub.psubscribe("__keyspace@0__:abcd*")?;

    println!("Subscribed to relevant keyspace notifications.");

    // --- 4. Event Loop ---
    loop {
        match pubsub.get_message() {
            Ok(msg) => {
                let channel: String = msg.get_channel_name().to_string();
                let payload: String = msg.get_payload()?; // This is the key name for keyevent notifications

                // For keyevent notifications like __keyevent@0__:set, the payload is the key.
                if channel == "__keyevent@0__:set" && payload.starts_with("abcd") {
                    let key = payload;
                    println!("Key '{}' was set.", key);

                    // Fetch the value of the key
                    // It's important to use a different connection for commands while one is blocked on pubsub.
                    match con.get::<&str, Option<String>>(&key) {
                        Ok(Some(value)) => {
                            println!("  Key: '{}', Value: '{}'", key, value);
                        }
                        Ok(None) => {
                            // This might happen if the key was deleted immediately after set,
                            // or if the notification arrives before the value is fully queryable in some edge cases.
                            println!("  Key: '{}', Value: (not found or was deleted quickly)", key);
                        }
                        Err(e) => {
                            eprintln!("  Error fetching value for key '{}': {}", key, e);
                        }
                    }
                }
                // If you subscribed to __keyspace@0__:abcd* instead:
                // let event_type: String = msg.get_payload()?; // This would be "set", "del", etc.
                // if event_type == "set" {
                //     // The actual key is part of the channel name in this case
                //     let parts: Vec<&str> = channel.splitn(2, ':').collect();
                //     if parts.len() == 2 {
                //         let key_from_channel = parts[1];
                //         if key_from_channel.starts_with("abcd") {
                //             println!("Key '{}' event: {}", key_from_channel, event_type);
                //             match con.get::<&str, Option<String>>(key_from_channel) {
                //                 Ok(Some(value)) => {
                //                     println!("  Key: '{}', Value: '{}'", key_from_channel, value);
                //                 }
                //                 Ok(None) => {
                //                     println!("  Key: '{}', Value: (not found or was deleted quickly)", key_from_channel);
                //                 }
                //                 Err(e) => {
                //                     eprintln!("  Error fetching value for key '{}': {}", key_from_channel, e);
                //                 }
                //             }
                //         }
                //     }
                // }
            }
            Err(e) => {
                eprintln!("Error receiving pubsub message: {}", e);
                // Implement reconnection logic if necessary
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Connect to Redis**:
    *   `redis::Client::open("redis://127.0.0.1/")?` creates a client.
    *   `client.get_connection()?` gets a regular connection (`con`) for commands like `GET` and `CONFIG SET`.
    *   Another connection (`pubsub_con`) is obtained specifically for Pub/Sub operations because a connection in Pub/Sub mode is blocked listening for messages and cannot run other commands. [[3]](https://gist.github.com/esemeniuc/f2d394040963463b261406fdcb77d076)[[4]](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/build-an-actix-web-endpoint-to-see-live-changes-of-my-redis-cache/109333)

2.  **Configure Keyspace Notifications (Commented Out)**:
    *   The line `con.config_set("notify-keyspace-events", "KEA")?` is commented out. It's best practice to configure `notify-keyspace-events` directly in your `redis.conf` file or set it once via `redis-cli`. [[1]](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/keyspace-notifications/)[[5]](https://redisson.pro/blog/redis-notifications-in-java.html) Doing it from the client on every startup can be redundant.

3.  **Subscribe to Keyspace Events**:
    *   `pubsub_con.as_pubsub()` converts the connection into a `PubSub` object.
    *   `pubsub.psubscribe("__keyevent@0__:set")?`: This subscribes to a pattern.
        *   `__keyevent@0__:set`: This pattern listens for all `set` events occurring in database `0`. [[1]](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/keyspace-notifications/)[[6]](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurepaasblog/redis-keyspace-events-notifications/1551134) The actual key that was set will be in the message payload. [[1]](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/keyspace-notifications/)
        *   We then filter messages in the loop to check if the key (from the payload) starts with "abcd".
    *   **Alternative Subscription**: You could also subscribe to `__keyspace@0__:abcd*`. [[4]](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/build-an-actix-web-endpoint-to-see-live-changes-of-my-redis-cache/109333)[[7]](https://dev.to/sayganov/redis-keyspace-notifications-with-a-c-example-2ahp) In this case, the channel name in the received message would be like `__keyspace@0__:abcdsomekey`, and the payload would be the type of event (e.g., "set"). The commented-out section in the loop shows how to handle this.

4.  **Event Loop**:
    *   `pubsub.get_message()?` blocks until a message is received on a subscribed channel.
    *   `msg.get_channel_name()`: Gets the name of the channel the message came from.
    *   `msg.get_payload()?`:
        *   If subscribed to `__keyevent@0__:set`, the payload is the *name of the key* that was affected. [[1]](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/keyspace-notifications/)
        *   If subscribed to `__keyspace@0__:abcd*`, the payload is the *name of the event* (e.g., "set", "del").
    *   **Filtering**: The code checks if the `channel` is `__keyevent@0__:set` and if the `payload` (which is the key name in this case) `starts_with("abcd")`.
    *   **Fetching Value**: If a matching "set" event occurs for a key starting with "abcd":
        *   `con.get::<&str, Option<String>>(&key)`: The regular connection `con` is used to fetch the value of the modified key. It's crucial to use a separate connection for this, as the `pubsub` connection is busy listening. [[8]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18328058/redis-notifications-get-key-and-value-on-expiration)[[9]](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/138300/how-to-get-old-and-new-values-on-redis-notification)
        *   The result is printed.

**Before Running:**

*   **Install `redis-rs`**: Add `redis = { version = "0.25", features = ["tokio-comp"] }` (or the latest version) to your `Cargo.toml`. You might also need `tokio` if you plan to use async, though this example is synchronous.
*   **Ensure Redis is Running**: Have a Redis server running on `127.0.0.1:6379`.
*   **Enable Keyspace Notifications**: As mentioned in step 1, make sure they are enabled in your Redis server (e.g., `CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events KEA` via `redis-cli`). [[1]](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/keyspace-notifications/)

This snippet provides a solid foundation for reacting to specific key changes in Redis using Rust. Remember that Redis Pub/Sub is "fire and forget"; if your client disconnects, messages sent during that time are lost. [[1]](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/keyspace-notifications/)
