The initial tests revealed that non-greedy patterns are essential for handling the variable order of fields. However, I'm finding that the pattern complexity grows quickly as I add more fields. I'm also testing different variations of capture groups for string, number, and boolean types.

My plan is to match a series of key-value pairs, each with a non-greedy skip preceding it. This structure should handle the varying field order. I will also be testing the different datatypes. The goal is to extract fields like `prop_trace_id`, `prop_user_name`, and their corresponding values, regardless of their order within the properties string.

My initial attempt involves isolating the "properties" content and using a series of non-greedy matches to extract the known subfields like `prop_trace_id`, `prop_user_name`, and others, regardless of their order within that string. This pattern is becoming quite verbose due to the need to cater for various data types (strings, numbers, booleans) and handle the variable order of the keys.

Okay, this is a much more tractable problem! If you have the specific field names you want to extract from the "properties" object, we can construct a `GROK` pattern to pull them out, even if their order within the "properties" object varies.

**The Strategy:**

1.  **Locate "properties" Object:** The `GROK` pattern will first find the beginning of the "properties" object string (e.g., `"properties"\s*:\s*\{`).
2.  **Targeted Extraction for Each Known Field:** For each field name you provide, we'll add a segment to the `GROK` pattern that looks for that specific key and captures its value.
3.  **Handle Variable Order:** The key to handling variable order is to use non-greedy matchers (like `[^}]*?`) *before* searching for each specific key-value pair within the "properties" object. This tells Grok to "skip anything (that's not a closing brace of the current object) until you find the specific key I'm looking for next."
4.  **Capture Values:** Values will be captured as strings initially. Numeric or boolean strings can then be converted using `EVAL` with `TO_LONG()`, `TO_DOUBLE()`, or `IF()` conditions.

**Let's Make Up Some Field Names within "properties":**

Suppose these are the fields you're interested in from the "properties" object:

1.  `trace_identifier` (String) - We'll use this for grouping.
2.  `current_process_phase` (String) - We'll use this for the "done"/"in progress" status logic.
3.  `item_count` (Number)
4.  `is_validated` (Boolean - represented as `true` or `false` in the JSON string)
5.  `notes` (String, optional)

**Example `log.message` string:**

`INFO UserA - ActionX - Details: {"timestamp":"2023-10-27T12:00:00Z", "main_event_id":"evt-001", "properties":{"item_count":150, "current_process_phase":"in progress", "is_validated":true, "trace_identifier":"tx-main-stream-001", "notes":"Initial processing"}, "source_ip":"192.168.1.10"}`

Notice how `item_count` appears before `current_process_phase` in this example. Our pattern needs to handle this.

**ES|QL Query:**

```esql
FROM "your-index-pattern-*"

// 1. GROK to extract specific known fields from the "properties" object, handling variable order.
// This pattern is complex. Read comments carefully.
| GROK log.message BY """
  .*? // Skip any prefix before the main JSON structure containing "properties"
  "properties"\s*:\s*\{ // Find the start of the "properties" object
  // For each field we want, we use a non-greedy skip [^}]*? to find it,
  // allowing other fields to appear before it.
  // This makes the pattern order-independent for these specific captures.

  [^}]*? // Non-greedy skip until the "trace_identifier" key (or end of object)
  "trace_identifier"\s*:\s*"(?<g_trace_identifier>[^"]*)" // Capture string trace_identifier

  [^}]*? // Non-greedy skip until the "current_process_phase" key
  "current_process_phase"\s*:\s*"(?<g_current_process_phase>[^"]*)" // Capture string current_process_phase

  [^}]*? // Non-greedy skip until the "item_count" key
  "item_count"\s*:\s*(?<g_item_count_str>[^,}]+) // Capture item_count (as string, unquoted number)

  [^}]*? // Non-greedy skip until the "is_validated" key
  "is_validated"\s*:\s*(?<g_is_validated_str>true|false) // Capture boolean (as string "true" or "false")

  // For the optional "notes" field:
  // We make the entire block for "notes" optional using (?:...)?
  // If "notes" is not present, this part of the pattern won't cause a failure.
  (?: // Start of optional non-capturing group for notes
    [^}]*? // Non-greedy skip until the "notes" key
    "notes"\s*:\s*"(?<g_notes>[^"]*)" // Capture string notes
  )? // End of optional group for notes

  [^}]*? // Consume any remaining characters until the end of the "properties" object
  \} // Match the closing brace of the "properties" object
  .*? // Skip any suffix after the main JSON structure
  """
// Note: If a *mandatory* field (like trace_identifier) is missing from a log, that log won't match this pattern.
// The `(?:...)?` syntax makes a group optional. It's used here for `g_notes`.

// 2. Filter out rows where critical extractions failed
| WHERE IS_NOT_NULL(g_trace_identifier) AND g_trace_identifier != "" AND
        IS_NOT_NULL(g_current_process_phase) AND g_current_process_phase != ""
        // Add checks for other mandatory extracted fields if needed

// 3. Convert extracted strings to their proper types using EVAL
| EVAL
    numeric_item_count = TO_LONG(g_item_count_str), // Convert item_count string to a long integer
    boolean_is_validated = IF(g_is_validated_str == "true", true, false) // Convert "true"/'false" string to boolean

// 4. Group by the extracted trace_identifier and aggregate other values
| STATS
    status_array = VALUES(g_current_process_phase), // Collect all process phases for the trace
    avg_item_count = AVG(numeric_item_count),       // Calculate average item count
    // For booleans, VALUES will give [true, false], [true], or [false]
    // You might want to see if ANY were true, or if ALL were true, etc.
    // Example: count how many times is_validated was true
    count_validated_true = COUNT_MATCH(boolean_is_validated, true),
    // Or get an array of the boolean values
    validation_flags = VALUES(boolean_is_validated),
    // For optional notes, you might take the first one found or list all
    all_notes = VALUES(g_notes)
BY g_trace_identifier

// 5. Determine the final_status based on the current_process_phase
| EVAL final_status =
    IF(
        CONTAINS(status_array, "done"), // Assuming "done" is a possible phase
        "done",
        IF(
            CONTAINS(status_array, "in progress"), // Assuming "in progress" is possible
            "in progress",
            IF(ARRAY_LENGTH(status_array) > 0, status_array[0], "unknown") // Fallback
        )
    )
| EVAL final_notes = IF(ARRAY_LENGTH(all_notes) > 0, all_notes[0], NULL) // Example: take first note

// 6. Prepare the final output
| RENAME g_trace_identifier AS trace_id
| KEEP trace_id, final_status, avg_item_count, count_validated_true, final_notes // Add/remove fields as needed
| SORT trace_id ASC
| LIMIT 1000
```

**Explanation of Key `GROK` Pattern Parts:**

*   **`"properties"\s*:\s*\{`**: Finds the beginning of the "properties" object.
*   **`[^}]*?`**: This is a crucial non-greedy matcher. It means "match any character that is NOT a closing curly brace (`}`), and do it as few times as possible." This allows the pattern to "jump" over other key-value pairs until it finds the specific key it's looking for next.
*   **`"key_name"\s*:\s*"(?<capture_name>[^"]*)"`**: Standard capture for a string value.
*   **`"key_name"\s*:\s*(?<capture_name_str>[^,}]+)`**: For unquoted numeric values. Captures as a string.
*   **`"key_name"\s*:\s*(?<capture_name_str>true|false)`**: For unquoted boolean values. Captures "true" or "false" as a string.
*   **`(?: ... )?`**: This creates an optional non-capturing group. Used here for the `g_notes` field to allow logs where "notes" is missing to still match the overall pattern. If a field is truly optional, you should wrap its entire extraction block `([^}]*? "key" ... value)` in this. If a field you *don't* mark as optional is missing, the entire `GROK` will fail for that log line.
*   **`\}`**: Matches the closing brace of the "properties" object.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Precision is Key:** This `GROK` pattern must be very precise. Any small deviation in your actual JSON string structure (like a key name typo, or a number being unexpectedly quoted) can cause the pattern to fail for that log message.
*   **Mandatory vs. Optional Fields in "properties":**
    *   If a field like `g_trace_identifier` or `g_current_process_phase` (which are critical for the query logic) is *not* wrapped in an optional group `(?:...)?` and is missing from the "properties" object in a log, that log message will **not** be parsed by this `GROK` pattern, and will likely be filtered out by the subsequent `WHERE` clause.
    *   If a field is genuinely optional (like `g_notes` in the example), wrap its entire find-and-capture block in `(?: ... )?`.
*   **Nested Objects within "properties":** If the subfields within "properties" are themselves nested objects, and you need fields from *those* deeper objects, the `GROK` pattern will become even more complex, requiring you to describe the path into those nested structures as well.
*   **Testing:** Test this pattern thoroughly with various examples of your `log.message` strings using the ES|QL query editor (with a `LIMIT 10` initially) to ensure it extracts the fields correctly.

This approach allows you to extract a *known set* of fields from your "properties" object, regardless of their order, using only the ES|QL commands you have available.
