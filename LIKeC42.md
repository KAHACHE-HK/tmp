Excellent question. You've hit on the core strength of the C4 model and languages like LikeC4: the ability to represent a system at different levels of abstraction and navigate between them.

Yes, we can absolutely modify the script to support this drill-down capability. The strategy is to treat each service as a container and the functions (represented by `span.name` in our traces) as components within that container.

Here's how we'll enhance the script:

1.  **Identify Components:** For each service, we'll parse the `span.name` of its spans to identify the individual "components" or "functions" operating within it.
2.  **Model Nested Elements:** We will update the LikeC4 generation to define `component` elements *inside* their respective `system` (service) blocks.
3.  **Map Detailed Relationships:** The connections will now be mapped from component to component, not just service to service. This includes:
    *   **Intra-service calls:** A component in a service calling another component in the *same* service.
    *   **Inter-service calls:** A component in one service calling a component in *another* service.
4.  **Create Multiple Views:** This is the key to the drill-down feature. We will generate:
    *   A high-level **System View** (`index`) that shows only the services and their interactions.
    *   A detailed **Component View** for each service that "zooms in" to show its internal components and their specific connections.
5.  **Enable Navigation:** We will add navigation links in the LikeC4 code so that clicking on a service in the high-level view takes you to its detailed component view.

### The Final Enhanced Python Script with Drill-Down

### Key Concepts in the Solution

1.  **Nested Element Definition**: The script now generates C4 code like this, which defines components *within* a system. This is the structural foundation for the drill-down.
    ```c4
    system api_gateway "api-gateway" {
      component GET__orders__id_ "GET /orders/{id}"
      component authorize_request "authorize_request"
      // ...
    }
    ```

2.  **Component-to-Component Relationships**: The relationships are now more granular, pointing from a specific component in one service to a specific component in another.
    ```c4
    // External call
    api_gateway.authorize_request -> orders_service.fetch_order "GRPC"

    // Internal call
    api_gateway.GET__orders__id_ -> api_gateway.authorize_request
    ```

3.  **View-Based Navigation**: The magic of the drill-down happens in the `views` block.
    *   **`view index of system`**: This creates the initial high-level map. It includes all systems (`include *`) but, by default, hides the component-level details.
    *   **`navigateTo view_of_... on ...`**: This is a LikeC4 directive. It makes the `api-gateway` system element a clickable link that opens the `view_of_api_gateway` view.
    *   **`view view_of_api_gateway of system`**: This is a dedicated view for the `api-gateway`.
        *   `include api_gateway.*`: This command tells the view to show the `api_gateway` system *and all of its components (`*`)* and their internal relationships.
        *   `include orders_service`: To provide context, it also shows the other services that `api-gateway` talks to, but *only as a single box*, without revealing their internal components.

### How to Use and Visualize

1.  **Run the Python script** as before. It will generate the `service_map_drilldown.c4` file.
2.  **Use a LikeC4 Viewer**: The best way to see the result is with the [LikeC4 for VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=likec4.likec4-vscode).
3.  **Interact with the Diagram**:
    *   When you open the `.c4` file, the initial `index` view will show you the three services (`api-gateway`, `orders-service`, `postgres-db`) and the connections between them.
    *   Click on the `api-gateway` box. The view will automatically transition to the `view_of_api_gateway`, showing you the components inside it (`GET /orders/{id}`, `authorize_request`, etc.) and their connections.

This enhanced script provides a powerful, automated way to generate multi-layered architectural diagrams that stay perfectly in sync with the actual runtime behavior of your application.
