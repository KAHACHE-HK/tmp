Now I'm focused on precisely documenting the change from the default multi-threaded runtime to the `current_thread` flavor for single-threaded operation. I'm also noting that the Redis interaction, leveraging `redis-rs` and its `tokio-comp` feature, remains asynchronous and efficient within this single-threaded context.

Yes, you can configure the Tokio runtime to be single-threaded. This is useful if you want to avoid the overhead of a multi-threaded scheduler and ensure all your async tasks run on the same OS thread.

To make the previous `tokio` program run on a single-threaded runtime, you just need to modify the `#[tokio::main]` attribute.

**Change this:**

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> redis::RedisResult<()> {
    // ... rest of the code
}
```

**To this:**

```rust
#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
async fn main() -> redis::RedisResult<()> {
    // ... rest of the code
}
```

**Full Single-Threaded Async Code Snippet:**

Here's the complete code adjusted for a single-threaded Tokio runtime:

```rust
use redis::AsyncCommands; // Import for async commands like .get()
use futures_util::StreamExt; // For .next() on the pubsub stream

#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")] // Use the current_thread runtime
async fn main() -> redis::RedisResult<()> {
    println!("Starting single-threaded Tokio runtime.");

    // --- 1. Connect to Redis asynchronously ---
    let client = redis::Client::open("redis://127.0.0.1/")?;

    // Connection for regular commands (GET, CONFIG SET)
    let mut con = client.get_async_connection().await?;
    println!("Connected to Redis (for commands).");

    // Connection for Pub/Sub
    // It's important to get a new connection for pubsub as it will be consumed by the stream.
    let pubsub_client = client.clone(); // Clone the client to get another connection
    let mut pubsub_conn = pubsub_client.get_async_connection().await?;
    println!("Connected to Redis (for Pub/Sub).");


    // --- 2. Configure Keyspace Notifications (Optional here, better to set in redis.conf) ---
    // It's generally better to configure this in redis.conf or via redis-cli once.
    // If you must do it from the client:
    // let _: () = con.config_set("notify-keyspace-events", "KEA").await?;
    // println!("Ensured notify-keyspace-events is set (best to configure in redis.conf).");


    // --- 3. Subscribe to Keyspace Events ---
    let mut pubsub = pubsub_conn.into_pubsub(); // Convert to async PubSub

    pubsub.psubscribe("__keyevent@0__:set").await?;
    // Alternatively, for keyspace notifications on a pattern:
    // pubsub.psubscribe("__keyspace@0__:abcd*").await?;

    println!("Subscribed to relevant keyspace notifications. Waiting for key changes starting with 'abcd'...");

    // --- 4. Event Loop using Stream ---
    let mut message_stream = pubsub.on_message();

    loop {
        tokio::select! {
            // Biased select ensures that we prioritize processing messages if available.
            // For a single task like this, `biased` has less impact but is good practice
            // if other branches were added that might starve the message stream.
            biased;

            Some(msg) = message_stream.next() => {
                let channel: String = msg.get_channel_name().to_string();
                let payload: String = match msg.get_payload() {
                    Ok(p) => p,
                    Err(e) => {
                        eprintln!("Error getting payload: {}", e);
                        continue;
                    }
                };

                if channel == "__keyevent@0__:set" && payload.starts_with("abcd") {
                    let key = payload; // payload is the key name
                    println!("Key '{}' was set.", key);

                    match con.get::<&str, Option<String>>(&key).await {
                        Ok(Some(value)) => {
                            println!("  Single-Threaded Async - Key: '{}', Value: '{}'", key, value);
                        }
                        Ok(None) => {
                            println!("  Single-Threaded Async - Key: '{}', Value: (not found or was deleted quickly)", key);
                        }
                        Err(e) => {
                            eprintln!("  Single-Threaded Async - Error fetching value for key '{}': {}", key, e);
                        }
                    }
                }
                // Example if you subscribed to __keyspace@0__:abcd* instead:
                /*
                else if channel.starts_with("__keyspace@0__:abcd") {
                    let event_type = payload; // payload is the event type ("set", "del", etc.)
                    if event_type == "set" {
                        // Extract key from channel name
                        let key_from_channel = channel.splitn(2, ':').nth(1).unwrap_or_default();
                        println!("Keyspace event: Channel '{}', Key '{}', Event: '{}'", channel, key_from_channel, event_type);

                        if !key_from_channel.is_empty() {
                             match con.get::<&str, Option<String>>(key_from_channel).await {
                                Ok(Some(value)) => {
                                    println!("  Single-Threaded Async - Key: '{}', Value: '{}'", key_from_channel, value);
                                }
                                Ok(None) => {
                                    println!("  Single-Threaded Async - Key: '{}', Value: (not found or was deleted quickly)", key_from_channel);
                                }

                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
                */
            }
            else => {
                // Stream ended or error
                eprintln!("PubSub message stream ended or encountered an error.");
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Explanation of the Change:**

*   **`#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]`**:
    *   This attribute tells Tokio to use its "current_thread" runtime scheduler.
    *   The "current_thread" scheduler runs all spawned tasks and the runtime itself on the thread that created the runtime (in this case, the main thread).
    *   It's lighter weight than the default "multi_thread" scheduler as it doesn't need thread synchronization primitives for task scheduling.

**Implications:**

*   **Concurrency, Not Parallelism**: Your program will still be asynchronous and handle multiple operations concurrently (e.g., waiting for Redis messages while being ready for other potential I/O). However, all these operations will be managed by a single OS thread. This means you won't get true parallelism (multiple tasks running simultaneously on different CPU cores).
*   **CPU-Bound Tasks**: If you had CPU-bound tasks within your async code, a single-threaded runtime would mean they block other async tasks on that same thread. For I/O-bound work like this Redis example, it's generally fine and can even be more efficient due to reduced overhead.
*   **Simplicity**: For some applications, a single-threaded runtime can simplify reasoning about state, as you don't have to worry about complex multi-threaded synchronization issues beyond what `async/await` already handles for sequential consistency within a task.

The rest of the code (how you use `redis-rs`, `async/await`, streams, etc.) remains the same because `redis-rs`'s `tokio-comp` feature is designed to work with Tokio's abstraction of an executor, regardless of whether it's single or multi-threaded.
