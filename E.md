I need to confirm that ES|QL's string functions or potential JSON parsing functions can extract data based on the structure. I'll check which functions are applicable for that, like regex extraction or any built-in JSON parsing. My focus has now shifted to query construction and testing its results.

Using ingest pipelines in Elasticsearch to parse the JSON before it's indexed and create separate fields is a cleaner approach. This simplifies ES|QL queries significantly.

The goal is string manipulation or regex to extract fields and then evaluate the results. I'll start by identifying the specific log messages to use as test data. Then I will attempt to apply the regex functions to see if I can get the needed values.

This approach means I need to build the right Grok patterns to capture data based on the log structure. I am now working on the most effective way to define these patterns, while considering data types like strings and numbers.

Yes, you absolutely can use an ES|QL visualization (specifically a table) in Kibana to create specific columns from fields located within a stringified JSON inside a log message. ES|QL provides powerful functions to extract and transform data on the fly.

The primary ES|QL command you'll use for this is **`EXTRACT`**, often in combination with **`EVAL`** for further refinement or type conversion.

Here's how you can approach this, along with explanations and examples:

**Core ES|QL Concepts for This Task:**

1.  **`FROM <your_index_pattern>`:** Specifies the data source.
2.  **`EXTRACT <field_with_json_string> BY "<grok_or_regex_pattern_with_named_captures>"`:** This is the key command. It allows you to apply a pattern (often a Grok-like pattern which can include regex named capture groups) to a field containing the stringified JSON. Each named capture group in your pattern will become a new field (column) in your results.
3.  **`EVAL <new_column_name> = <expression>`:** Allows you to create new columns or modify existing ones. This is useful for:
    *   Converting extracted text to numbers (`TO_LONG()`, `TO_DOUBLE()`).
    *   Handling cases where a key might be missing (`COALESCE()`, `IF(IS_NULL(...))`).
    *   Further transformations.
4.  **`KEEP <column1>, <column2>, ...`:** Selects which columns you want in your final output table.

**Example Scenario:**

Let's assume your log messages are in an index pattern `my-logs-*`, and they have a field named `log.message` which contains a stringified JSON like this:

```json
// Content of log.message field (as a single string)
"{\"event_id\":\"abc-123\", \"user_id\":\"user@example.com\", \"action\":\"login\", \"duration_ms\":150, \"success\":true}"
```

You want to create a table with columns: `event_id`, `user_id`, `action`, `duration_ms`, and `success_status`.

**ES|QL Query:**

```esql
FROM "my-logs-*"
| EXTRACT log.message BY """
  {"event_id":"(?<event_id_str>[^"]*)",
  "user_id":"(?<user_id_str>[^"]*)",
  "action":"(?<action_str>[^"]*)",
  "duration_ms":(?<duration_ms_raw>[^,]+),
  "success":(?<success_raw>[^}]+)}
  """
| EVAL duration_ms_num = TO_LONG(duration_ms_raw)
| EVAL success_status_bool = IF(success_raw == "true", true, false) // Handle boolean as string
// Or, if success could be missing or malformed:
// | EVAL success_status_bool = COALESCE(IF(success_raw == "true", true, IF(success_raw == "false", false, NULL)), false) // Default to false if missing/invalid
| KEEP timestamp, event_id_str, user_id_str, action_str, duration_ms_num, success_status_bool
// You might want to rename columns for the final table using EVAL:
// | EVAL EventID = event_id_str, User = user_id_str, Action = action_str, Duration = duration_ms_num, Successful = success_status_bool
// | KEEP timestamp, EventID, User, Action, Duration, Successful
| LIMIT 100 // Always good to limit results for visualization performance
```

**Explanation of the `EXTRACT` Pattern:**

*   `"""..."""`: Using triple quotes allows for multi-line strings and avoids excessive escaping of double quotes within the pattern.
*   `{"event_id":"(?<event_id_str>[^"]*)", ... }`: This is a Grok-like pattern.
    *   `event_id`: Matches the literal key in the JSON string.
    *   `":"`: Matches the colon and quotes around the value.
    *   `(?<event_id_str>[^"]*)`: This is a named capture group.
        *   `?<event_id_str>`:  Creates a new field named `event_id_str`.
        *   `[^"]*`: Matches any character that is not a double quote, zero or more times (captures the value).
    *   `duration_ms":(?<duration_ms_raw>[^,]+)`: For numbers, we capture everything until the next comma or closing brace. This might capture the raw number as a string.
    *   `success":(?<success_raw>[^}]+)`: For booleans (which are not quoted in JSON), we capture until the closing brace.

**Steps in Kibana to Create the Table Visualization:**

1.  **Create Visualization:** Go to "Visualize Library" and click "Create visualization."
2.  **Choose ES|QL:** Select "ES|QL Query" as the visualization type.
3.  **Data Source:** Choose your index pattern (e.g., `my-logs-*`).
4.  **ES|QL Query Pane:** Enter the ES|QL query you constructed (like the example above).
5.  **Configure Table:**
    *   Once the query runs and returns data, the fields you `KEEP` (or all fields if `KEEP` is not used) will be available.
    *   In the table configuration panel (often on the right), you can drag these fields into the "Columns" section.
    *   You can reorder columns and set formatting options.

**Important Considerations and Best Practices:**

*   **Complexity of JSON:**
    *   If your JSON is deeply nested or has arrays you want to flatten/extract, the `EXTRACT` pattern can become very complex and harder to maintain.
    *   For very complex JSON, parsing at ingestion time (using Logstash or an Elasticsearch Ingest Pipeline) is generally a more robust and performant solution. The resulting parsed fields can then be easily used in ES|QL without complex extraction.
*   **Performance:** On-the-fly extraction with `EXTRACT` is powerful but can be less performant than querying pre-parsed fields, especially on very large datasets or with very complex patterns.
*   **Error Handling & Missing Keys:**
    *   The `EXTRACT` command will result in `null` values for captured fields if the pattern doesn't match (e.g., a key is missing in some JSON strings).
    *   Use `COALESCE(<field_name>, <default_value>)` in an `EVAL` step to provide default values for missing keys.
    *   Use `IF(IS_NULL(...))` or `IS_FINITE()` for conditional logic.
*   **Data Type Conversion:**
    *   `EXTRACT` usually captures values as strings. Use `TO_LONG()`, `TO_DOUBLE()`, `TO_BOOLEAN()` (if available, or use `IF` logic as shown for booleans) in `EVAL` steps to convert them to the correct data types for sorting, aggregation, or specific formatting in the table.
*   **Fragility of Patterns:** If the structure of your stringified JSON changes (e.g., key names change, order changes significantly in a way that breaks a loose pattern), your `EXTRACT` pattern might stop working correctly.
*   **User Rights:** Writing ES|QL queries for visualizations is generally available to users who can create visualizations in Kibana. You don't typically need special admin rights to write the ES|QL itself, *unless* your query tries to access features or data for which you don't have underlying Elasticsearch permissions. The extraction happens within the scope of the ES|QL query execution.

**Alternative if `EXTRACT` becomes too complex:**

If you have "just user rights" but can request changes, ask your ELK administrator to:

1.  **Implement Ingest Pipelines:** To parse the JSON string into proper fields when data is indexed.
2.  **Define Runtime Fields:** In the index mapping, a runtime field can be defined using a script (e.g., Painless) to parse the JSON string at query time. ES|QL can then directly use these runtime fields.

However, if you need a solution purely within an ES|QL visualization using your current user rights, `EXTRACT` is the way to go for this specific task. Start with a simple JSON structure and gradually build up your pattern. Test frequently with a small `LIMIT` in your ES|QL.
