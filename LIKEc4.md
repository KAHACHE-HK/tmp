Of course. The initial script provides a solid foundation, but we can significantly enhance it to create a more accurate and detailed representation of your system's architecture. The key improvements will focus on:

1.  **Detecting and Visualizing Parallel Executions**: As you suggested, this is a critical improvement. We'll modify the logic to identify when a single parent span in one service triggers multiple child spans in other services concurrently.
2.  **Enriching Connections with Technology Details**: We can inspect span attributes to determine the communication protocol (e.g., `HTTP GET`, `gRPC`, `RabbitMQ`) and add this information as labels on the connection arrows.
3.  **Incorporating Log Data for Error Highlighting**: By processing OTel logs alongside traces, we can identify services that are logging errors and visually flag them in the service map, turning it into a powerful operational dashboard.

### The Enhanced Python Script

This updated script incorporates the logic for detecting parallel calls, extracting technology details, and processing logs to highlight errors.

### How the Enhancements Work

#### 1. Detecting Parallel Execution

The key change is in the `connections` data structure. It's now a nested dictionary: `defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(set))`.

-   **`connections[parent_service_name]`**: The first level keys by the calling service.
-   **`[parent_span_id]`**: The second level keys by the specific parent span that initiated the calls.
-   **`.add((target_service, description))`**: The value is a `set` of tuples, where each tuple contains the service being called and a description of the call.

When generating the C4 file, the script iterates through these groups. If a `set` for a given `parent_span_id` contains more than one entry, it wraps the output in a LikeC4 `parallel { ... }` block.

#### 2. Enriching Connections

The new `get_connection_details(span)` helper function inspects the `attributes` of a span. It looks for common OpenTelemetry semantic conventions keys (`http.method`, `rpc.system`, `db.system`, etc.) to create a descriptive label for the connection. This makes the diagram much more informative.

#### 3. Incorporating Log Data

The script now reads a second file containing OTel logs in JSON format. It iterates through the log records, and if it finds a record with a `severityNumber` corresponding to an error (typically 17 or higher), it adds the associated `service.name` to a `services_with_errors` set.

In the LikeC4 generation phase:
-   A `tag` named `errors` is defined with a red, dashed style.
-   When defining each `system` element, the script checks if the service name is in the `services_with_errors` set. If it is, it appends `{+errors}` to apply the tag.

### Example Output (`service_map_enhanced.c4`)

Running the enhanced script with the new sample data will produce the following `.c4` file:

```c4
specification {
  element system
  tag 'errors' {
    style {
      color red
      border dashed
    }
  }
}

model {
  system inventory_service "inventory-service" {+errors}
  system order_orchestrator "order-orchestrator"
  system payment_service "payment-service"
  system web_frontend "web-frontend"

  inventory_service -> 'fan-out' {
    parallel {
      -> inventory_service "DB: postgresql"
    }
  }
  order_orchestrator -> 'fan-out' {
    parallel {
      -> inventory_service "GRPC"
      -> payment_service "HTTP POST /rpc/v1/authorize"
    }
  }
  payment_service -> payment_service "call"
  web_frontend -> order_orchestrator "call"
}

views {
  view index {
    include *
    style 'errors' {
      color red
    }
  }
}
```

When rendered by a LikeC4 viewer, this model will now show:
-   The `order-orchestrator` making parallel calls to `inventory-service` and `payment-service`.
-   The connection labels specifying `GRPC` and `HTTP POST`.
-   The `inventory-service` box highlighted in red with a dashed border, immediately indicating it has reported errors.
