It's a good choice because it allows us to visit neighbors in a level-by-level fashion, which can be important if the node's score calculation needs the latest scores of its immediate neighbors. Now, I'm thinking about how to manage the recalculation queue efficiently using Rust's standard library.

Of course. This is an excellent problem that showcases how to handle data dependencies and propagation in Rust. The key is to model the graph correctly and then use a graph traversal algorithm to propagate the changes.

Since your graph is **undirected and acyclic**, it's technically a **forest** (a collection of trees). If it's always connected, it's a **tree**. This acyclic property is crucial because it prevents infinite recalculation loops.

Here is a complete, well-documented Rust solution that demonstrates how to build the graph, update a node, and recalculate the scores of all affected nodes.

### Core Concepts of the Solution

1.  **Graph Representation**: We'll use an adjacency list stored in a `HashMap`. This is efficient for sparse graphs and makes it easy to find the neighbors of any given node.
    *   `nodes: HashMap<NodeId, Node>`: Stores the actual node data, keyed by a unique ID.
    *   `adjacency: HashMap<NodeId, HashSet<NodeId>>`: Stores the graph structure. For each node ID, we have a set of connected neighbor IDs. A `HashSet` is used to prevent duplicate edges automatically.

2.  **Node Logic**: Each `Node` will have its own `base_value` and a calculated `score`. The logic we'll implement for this example is: **A node's score is its own `base_value` plus the average score of its neighbors.** You can easily replace this logic with your own.

3.  **Recalculation Strategy**: When a node's value changes, its own score changes. This, in turn, may affect the scores of its neighbors, which may affect *their* neighbors, and so on. This ripple effect is best handled with a graph traversal algorithm.
    *   We will use a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** approach.
    *   We'll start a queue with the node that was initially changed.
    *   We will process each node in the queue, recalculating its score.
    *   **Crucially**: If a node's score *actually changes* after recalculation, we add all of its neighbors to the queue to be re-evaluated. If its score doesn't change, the propagation stops along that path, making the process efficient.

### How to Run the Code

1.  Make sure you have Rust installed (`rustup`).
2.  Create a new project: `cargo new rust_graph_recalc`
3.  Navigate into the project directory: `cd rust_graph_recalc`
4.  Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the code above.
5.  Run the project: `cargo run`

### Explanation of the Output

When you run the code, you will see a step-by-step log of what's happening:

1.  **Initial State**: All nodes are created with their scores equal to their `base_value` because they have no neighbors.
2.  **Adding Edges**: When you add an edge like `(1, 2)`, the code recalculates. Node 1's score now depends on Node 2, and vice-versa. The `recalculate_from` function is called, and you'll see the scores of nodes 1 and 2 (and potentially their other neighbors) change.
3.  **Cycle Detection**: The attempt to add an edge between 1 and 3 will fail because a path `1 -> 2 -> 3` already exists. The graph correctly identifies this as a cycle.
4.  **Updating a Node**:
    *   When you update Node 1 (a "leaf" node), the recalculation starts there. Its score changes. This change propagates to its only neighbor, Node 2. Node 2's score recalculates. If Node 2's score changes, it will then propagate to *its* other neighbors (3 and 4).
    *   When you update Node 2 (a "central" node), the effect is more immediate and widespread, propagating to all its neighbors (1, 3, and 4) directly.

### How to Customize and Improve

*   **Custom Score Logic**: The most important part for you to change is the `calculate_score_for_node` function. You can implement any logic you want here. It can be based on the node's own data, the number of neighbors, the max/min score of its neighbors, or any other complex rule.
*   **Performance**: For extremely large graphs, you might consider parallelizing the score calculations. However, this adds significant complexity due to potential data races when updating scores. The current single-threaded BFS approach is very robust and surprisingly fast for most use cases.
*   **Generics**: You could make the `NodeId` and the data within the `Node` struct generic to make the graph more reusable for different types of data.
*   **Error Handling**: The current error handling is basic (returning `String`s). For a production application, you would want to use a custom `Error` enum for more robust error management.
