Absolutely! Here’s how you can **efficiently launch 2,000 concurrent Redis connections** from a Rust client to your [Garnet](https://github.com/Microsoft/garnet) server and observe the impact:

---

## **Best Practices for High-Concurrency Rust Load Testing**

### **1. Use One Tokio Process With 2,000 Async Tasks**

- **Don’t spawn 2,000 separate OS processes**—that’s inefficient and unnecessary.
- Instead, use a **single Rust process** with **2,000 async tasks** (each task opens its own connection).
- This lets you maximize concurrency with minimal system overhead, and precisely control and monitor the workload.

---

### **2. Example Script: 2,000 Async Clients Doing PING**

```rust
use redis::AsyncCommands;
use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};

const NUM_CLIENTS: usize = 2_000;

#[tokio::main(flavor = "multi_thread", worker_threads = 4)]
async fn main() {
    let garnet_url = "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/"; // <-- Change to Garnet address/port

    // Spawn 2,000 concurrent tasks
    let mut handles = Vec::with_capacity(NUM_CLIENTS);

    for i in 0..NUM_CLIENTS {
        let url = garnet_url.to_string();
        let handle = tokio::spawn(async move {
            let client = match redis::Client::open(url) {
                Ok(c) => c,
                Err(e) => {
                    eprintln!("[{i}] Client open error: {e}");
                    return;
                }
            };
            let mut con = match client.get_async_connection().await {
                Ok(conn) => conn,
                Err(e) => {
                    eprintln!("[{i}] Redis connect error: {e}");
                    return;
                }
            };
            // Optional: Loop or just once
            match con.ping().await {
                Ok(val) => assert_eq!(val, "PONG"),
                Err(e) => eprintln!("[{i}] PING error: {e}"),
            }
            // Optional: keep connection alive
            sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Wait for all tasks to complete (here, after 5 seconds)
    for handle in handles {
        let _ = handle.await;
    }
    println!("All clients done.");
}
```

**This script:**
- Launches 2,000 concurrent async connections to your Garnet server.
- Each does a `PING`, then optionally waits 5 seconds to keep the connection open (so you can observe Garnet’s live connection count).

---

### **3. Increase System Limits**

- **Linux/macOS**:  
  ```sh
  ulimit -n 10000
  ```
- **Windows**: Defaults are usually fine for 2,000 sockets, but check Garnet’s and OS’s max connection limits.

---

### **4. Observe Garnet’s Metrics**

- Use Garnet’s CLI, dashboard, or logs to watch:
  - **Active connections**
  - **CPU, RAM usage**
  - **Throughput/latency metrics**

---

### **5. Optional Enhancements**

- **Sustained Load**: Loop inside each task, e.g., run `PING` or `GET`/`SET` in a loop, not just once.
- **Custom Commands**: Replace `PING` with any command or workload you want to simulate.
- **Randomized Delays**: Simulate real-world load by adding random sleeps or variable command intervals.

---

### **6. Monitor Client-Side for Errors**

- The script above will print errors if clients can’t connect or if connections are dropped—use this to spot when Garnet reaches its limits.

## **Summary Table**

| Step              | Action                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Raise ulimit      | `ulimit -n 10000` (Linux/macOS)                                        |
| Run Garnet        | Ensure it’s listening and ready                                        |
| Run Rust script   | Run the script above (`cargo run --release`)                           |
| Observe Garnet    | Use Garnet’s monitoring tools to watch connections, CPU, etc.          |

---

## **Why Not 2,000 Processes?**
- **Resource waste:** Each process = separate memory, scheduler entry, etc. With async Rust, you get 2,000+ connections in a single lightweight process.
- **Easier metric gathering and script control.**

---

## **Ready to Go!**
- Adjust the number (`NUM_CLIENTS`) as needed.
- For sustained load, add command loops or random delays.
- Monitor both client and server for errors, latency, and resource usage.

**Let me know if you want a version that runs a loop of commands per client, or that records per-client latency for benchmarking!**
